# Problem Solving Approach

## Problem Solving

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look back and refactor

## Understand The Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution
4. Can outputs be determined from the inputs? (i.e. enough info to solve problem)
5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem

## Explore Examples

- Start with Simple Examples
- Progress to more complex Examples
- Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

## Simplify

- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Incorporate the difficulty back in

## Refactoring Questions

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for other problems?
- Can you improve performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this propblem?

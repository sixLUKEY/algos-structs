// ===================================================================
//   Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// ===================================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
"implement addition";

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
/// - ints?
/// - floats?
/// - what about strings for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution
/// - int? float? string?

// 4. Can outputs be determined from the inputs? (i.e. enough info to solve problem)

// 5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem
